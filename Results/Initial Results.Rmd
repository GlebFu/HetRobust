Compare model based vs. empirical Saddlepoint Approximations.

```{r, cache = F, echo = F, warning = F, results = "asis"}
saddle <- filter(results, test == "saddle_V1" | test == "saddle_V2", criterion == "size") %>% 
  select(n, Estruct, Edist, HC, coef, test, p05) %>% 
  #melt(measure.vars = c("p01", "p05", "p10"), variable.name = "alpha", value.name = "p") %>%
  dcast(... ~ HC + test, value.var = "p05")


filter(saddle, Edist == "En", coef == "x0") %>% 
  select(-Edist, -coef) %>% 
  htmlTable(rnames = F)
  #stargazer(summary = F)

filter(saddle, Edist == "En", coef == "x1") %>% 
  select(-Edist, -coef) %>% 
  htmlTable(rnames = F)
  #stargazer(summary = F)

filter(saddle, Edist == "En", coef == "x2") %>% 
  select(-Edist, -coef) %>% 
  htmlTable(rnames = F)
